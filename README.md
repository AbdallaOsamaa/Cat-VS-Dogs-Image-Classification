# Cat-VS-Dogs-Image-Classification
This project aims to build and train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model capable of classifying images of cats and dogs. The model was developed and trained using TensorFlow and Keras, leveraging data preprocessing, augmentation, and model optimization techniques to achieve high classification accuracy.
