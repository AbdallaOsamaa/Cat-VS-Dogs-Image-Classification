#  Cats vs Dogs Image Classification using CNN

##  Project Overview
This project focuses on building and training a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** capable of classifying images of **cats and dogs**. It was developed using **TensorFlow** and **Keras**, and demonstrates end-to-end deep learning workflow â€” from data preprocessing to model evaluation.

---

##  Features
- Load and preprocess the Cats vs Dogs dataset (resizing, normalization, augmentation).
- Build a **Sequential CNN** model from scratch.
- Train and validate using callbacks like **EarlyStopping** and **ReduceLROnPlateau**.
- Visualize performance using accuracy/loss curves.
- Evaluate results with a **confusion matrix** and **classification report**.

##  Tech Stack
- **Language:** Python  
- **Frameworks:** TensorFlow, Keras  
- **Libraries:** NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, PIL  
- **Environment:** Google Colab  
- **Dataset:** Cats vs Dogs (Kaggle / Microsoft Dataset)

---

##  Model Architecture
- **Conv2D** layers for feature extraction  
- **MaxPooling2D** for spatial downsampling  
- **BatchNormalization** for stable learning  
- **Dropout** for regularization  
- **Dense layers** for classification  
- **Sigmoid activation** for binary output

---

##  Training Details
- **Optimizer:** Adam  
- **Loss Function:** Binary Crossentropy  
- **Batch Size:** 32  
- **Epochs:** Early stopped based on validation loss  
- **Metrics:** Accuracy  

**Callbacks Used:**  
- `EarlyStopping` â†’ Stop when validation loss stops improving  
- `ReduceLROnPlateau` â†’ Reduce learning rate automatically

---

##  Results
- Achieved validation accuracy between **95% â€“ 98%**
- Model generalizes well on unseen images
- Clear separation between cat and dog classes

---

##  Future Improvements
1. **Transfer Learning** using pretrained models (VGG16, ResNet50, EfficientNet).  
2. **Hyperparameter Tuning** with Keras Tuner or Optuna.  
3. **Data Augmentation Expansion** for better generalization.  
4. **Regularization Enhancements** (L2, BatchNorm).  
5. **Model Deployment** using Flask / Streamlit as a web app.  
6. **Explainability** using Grad-CAM for visual insights.
